The challenge of this project was to create a plausible app based on a random lottery of audience-type and API. My lottery ticket came up with Activists for the audience and the newsAPI for the endpoint.

The concept I came up with is a sort of mash-up of Flipboard and Pinterest: Users can track what topics they care about and get notified of local gatherings for meetups with others that share similiar interests.

### Project Goals

Pull in articles from the newsAPI
Allow users to save articles on issues that they care about
Allow users to comment on interesting articles
User can see a list of articles they follow.
Users can see local meetups with others who follow and share interests in the same issues.
