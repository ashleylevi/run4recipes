The challenge of this project was to create a user-friendly app based on a random lottery of audience-type and API. I recieved "runners" for my audience type and Edamam API for the endpoint.

Users can view various recipes either by category type or by searching. Users can click on recipes to access more details or add recipes to their favorites to view at a later time.
